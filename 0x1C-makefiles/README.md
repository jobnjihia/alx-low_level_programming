In this project folder, I have learnt and experimented with makefile concepts:

The make utility automatically determines which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them.

What are make, Makefiles
When, why and how to use Makefiles
What are rules and how to set and use them
What are explicit and implicit rules
What are the most common / useful rules
What are variables and how to set and use them.
